Tennis was a lot more complicated to port than soccer or cricket. The code on slimetennis.com seems to have been through several stages of compilation/decompilation.

The transformations I'm doing on both the Java and the TypeScript are very basic, and they got tripped up a lot by the method names in the original tennis code - almost all methods were an overloaded method called "a". TypeScript doesn't deal with overloading well at the best of times, and auto-generated TypeScript with RegEx-based async/await hacking is even worse.

So the reason for the bizarre class/method names is that used a Java IDE to rename all the overloaded single-letter methods to names generated by [a node name generator called `sillyname`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sillyname).

Apart from those renames, the source code is unmodified from the jar used for the original game at [slimetennis.com](http://slimetennis.com/onetennisbeta3a.jar).
